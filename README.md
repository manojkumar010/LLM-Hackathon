# Hackathon Challenge Solution - Essay Origin Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for a hackathon challenge where the task was to distinguish between essays written by students and those generated by a Language Model (LLM). The challenge involved using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze essays and predict their origins.

## Data Description
The dataset comprises of:
- `train.csv`: Training data with essay texts and labels indicating whether the essay was AI-generated.
- `test.csv`: Test data with essay texts.
- `train_prompts.csv`: Prompts data containing details like prompt name, instructions, and source text.

## Approach
### 1. Data Preprocessing
Merged the training and test datasets with the prompts data on 'prompt_id' to enrich the essays with prompt details.

### 2. Feature Engineering
Extracted basic text features including:
- Text Length
- Word Count
- Average Word Length

### 3. Model Building and Evaluation
Used a RandomForestClassifier for the task. The model was evaluated using the ROC AUC metric, achieving a high score on the validation set.

### 4. Submission
Predictions were made on the test set, and a submission file was prepared as per the competition guidelines.
